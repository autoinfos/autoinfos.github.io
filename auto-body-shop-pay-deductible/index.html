Because it was considered an act of nature, my insurance company had a higher deductible for that type of damage. It was a good reminder to read the fine print of my policy and understand exactly what I'm covered for.</p><h3>What Happens if You Can't Afford Your Auto Body Shop Pay Deductible?</h3><p>If you can't afford to pay your auto body shop pay deductible, you may be able to work out a payment plan with your insurance company or the auto body shop.
