This involves draining the old oil and replacing it with new oil to keep your engine running smoothly. I remember the first time I needed an oil change, and I had no idea what it meant. Thankfully, my mechanic was patient enough to explain it to me.During an oil change, the mechanic will drain the old oil from your car and replace it with new oil. They will also replace the oil filter, which helps remove any impurities from the oil. It&#39;s recommended to get an oil change every 5,000 miles or every six months, whichever comes first.What is a tune-up?A tune-up is a general maintenance service that includes a series of inspections, adjustments, and replacements. It&#39;s designed to keep your car running smoothly and prevent any major breakdowns. A tune-up typically includes replacing spark plugs, filters, and fluids, checking the ignition system, and inspecting the brakes and tires.When I took my car in for a tune-up, I was amazed at how much better it ran afterward. It felt like I was driving a brand new car. Getting a tune-up every year or every 30,000 miles can help prevent major repairs and extend the life of your car.What is a brake job?A brake job is a repair service that involves replacing the brake pads or shoes, resurfacing or replacing the rotors or drums, and flushing the brake fluid. It&#39;s necessary to get a brake job when you hear a squealing noise when you apply the brakes or if your brakes are not as responsive as they used to be. It&#39;s essential to get your brakes checked regularly to prevent any major issues.How to choose a reliable mechanic?Choosing a reliable mechanic can be challenging, especially if you don&#39;t know much about cars.

It felt like I was driving a brand new car. Getting a tune-up every year or every 30,000 miles can help prevent major repairs and extend the life of your car.</p><p><h3>What is a brake job?</h3></p><p>A brake job is a repair service that involves replacing the brake pads or shoes, resurfacing or replacing the rotors or drums, and flushing the brake fluid.
