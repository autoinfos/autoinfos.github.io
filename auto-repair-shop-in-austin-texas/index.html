Most people have. But what if auto repair shops could be transformed into warm and inviting spaces? That's exactly what we did with our latest project. We took an ordinary auto repair shop in Austin, Texas and turned it into a cozy haven. Read on to learn more about how we did it.</p><p>Let's face it - auto repair shops are not the most pleasant places to be. They are often loud, dirty, and filled with the smell of oil and gasoline.

We needed to make sure that the space was easy to clean and maintain, and that it was durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of daily use.</p><h2>Target: Auto Repair Shop in Austin, Texas</h2><p>One of the most rewarding parts of this project was seeing the reaction of customers when they saw the new space for the first time.
