The course covers topics such as aerodynamics, vehicle dynamics, and race engine design, and includes opportunities to work on student-led race teams.</p><p><h3>Automotive Technology</h3></p><p>If you are interested in the technical side of the automotive industry, studying automotive technology can be a great choice.

This course covers topics such as engine management systems, steering and suspension, and brake systems, and includes a mix of theory and practical learning.</p><p><h4>How to Succeed as an International Student in Automotive Courses in Australia</h4></p><p>As an international student studying automotive courses in Australia, it is important to be proactive in seeking out resources and support.
