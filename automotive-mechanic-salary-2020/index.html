According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $42,090 in May 2019. This means that half of all mechanics earned more than this amount, while the other half earned less.</p><p>In order to earn a higher salary, it's important to consider factors such as experience, education, and location.
