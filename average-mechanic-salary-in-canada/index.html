For example, mechanics who work for larger, more established companies may earn more than those who work for smaller or newer companies.Personally, I have found that working for a well-respected and established dealership has allowed me to earn a higher salary than I would have been able to at a smaller, independent garage.Negotiating Your SalaryIf you are feeling undervalued or underpaid in your current mechanic role, it may be worth considering negotiating your salary with your employer. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but it&#39;s important to advocate for yourself and your skills.One strategy for negotiating your salary is to do your research ahead of time and come prepared with data and information about the average mechanic salary in Canada, as well as your own experience and education.
