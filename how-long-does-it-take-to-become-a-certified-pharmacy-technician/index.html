Each setting has its own unique challenges, but I have found that the skills and knowledge I gained through my pharmacy technician program and certification have been invaluable in each setting.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q: Can you become a certified pharmacy technician without completing a pharmacy technician program?</b></p><p>A: No, completion of a pharmacy technician program is required in order to become a certified pharmacy technician.</p><p><b>Q: Are there any prerequisites for enrolling in a pharmacy technician program?</b></p><p>A: Prerequisites vary by program, but many programs require a high school diploma or equivalent and completion of certain prerequisite courses, such as math and science.</p><p><b>Q: Is the PTCE difficult to pass?</b></p><p>A: The difficulty of the PTCE can vary depending on the individual's knowledge and preparation.
