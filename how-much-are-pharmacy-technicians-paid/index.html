According to the National Healthcareer Association, pharmacy technicians who hold a certification typically earn more than those who are not certified. Additionally, certification can also help you stand out from other job candidates and may lead to more job opportunities.</p><h4>How to Become Certified as a Pharmacy Technician</h4><p>If you're interested in becoming certified as a pharmacy technician, there are a few steps you'll need to take. First, you'll need to complete a training program that is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).
