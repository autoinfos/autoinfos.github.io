If so, you may be wondering how much money you can expect to make in this field. The good news is that chiller technicians are in high demand, and the pay is typically quite competitive. In this blog post, we'll explore how much chiller techs make, as well as some factors that can affect their salaries.</p><h2>The Pain Points of Chiller Tech Salaries</h2><p>One of the biggest pain points for chiller technicians is that their salaries can vary widely depending on a number of factors. For example, chiller techs who work for larger companies or in more expensive areas may earn more money than those who work for smaller companies or in less expensive areas. Additionally, the level of experience and education of the chiller tech can also impact their salary.</p><h3>Answering the Question: How Much Do Chiller Techs Make?</h3><p>According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers (which includes chiller techs) was $48,730 as of May 2020. However, salaries can range from around $30,000 per year for entry-level positions to over $75,000 per year for more experienced chiller techs.</p><h4>Factors That Affect Chiller Tech Salaries</h4><p>As mentioned, there are several factors that can impact how much money a chiller technician can expect to make.

Additionally, the demand for skilled chiller technicians is only expected to grow in the coming years, which could lead to even higher salaries in the future.</p><h4>How to Negotiate Your Chiller Tech Salary</h4><p>If you're considering a new job as a chiller technician, it's important to know how to negotiate your salary.
