As with any job, it&#39;s important to know how much you can expect to make before diving in. In this article, we&#39;ll explore the average pay for dialysis techs at Fresenius and what factors affect their earnings.Working as a dialysis technician can be a rewarding career, but it&#39;s also a demanding one. Techs are responsible for operating and maintaining dialysis machines, monitoring patients&#39; vital signs, and ensuring the safety and comfort of patients during treatments. Unfortunately, the job can also be emotionally taxing, as dialysis patients typically require treatment several times a week for the rest of their lives.The national average pay for a dialysis tech is $41,000 per year according to Glassdoor. However, the average pay for techs at Fresenius is slightly higher at $44,000 per year. This is partly due to Fresenius being one of the largest dialysis providers in the country, with a strong focus on employee satisfaction and retention.In addition to base salary, dialysis techs at Fresenius may be eligible for bonuses, overtime pay, and other incentives. The company also offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, retirement planning, paid time off, and more.Personal Experience with Dialysis Tech SalaryAs a former dialysis tech at Fresenius, I can attest that the salary was competitive and fair.
