Are you considering becoming an ASE certified mechanic? If so, one of the main questions on your mind is likely, "how much does an ASE certified mechanic make?" The answer to this question depends on several factors, but in general, ASE certified mechanics can earn a competitive salary in the automotive industry. Keep reading to learn more about the earning potential of this career path.</p><p>There are several factors that can impact how much an ASE certified mechanic earns. For example, the mechanic's level of experience, the region where they work, and the type of employer they are working for can all impact their salary. However, despite these variables, ASE certified mechanics typically earn higher salaries than non-certified mechanics.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020. However, this figure can vary widely depending on the mechanic's level of experience, specialty, and location. For example, mechanics who specialize in more complex systems, such as hybrid or electric vehicles, may earn more than those who work on traditional gasoline engines. Additionally, mechanics who work for dealerships or other high-end automotive businesses may earn more than those who work for smaller repair shops.</p><h2>Personal Experience: How Much I Earn as an ASE Certified Mechanic</h2><p>As an ASE certified mechanic with 5 years of experience, I currently earn a salary of $55,000 per year. While this figure may not be representative of all ASE certified mechanics, it gives you an idea of the earning potential of this career path.

For example, mechanics who work for dealerships or other high-end automotive businesses may earn more than those who work for smaller repair shops.</p><h2>Personal Experience: How Employer Impacted My Salary</h2><p>I started my career working for a small, independent repair shop. While I enjoyed the work, I quickly realized that I could earn a higher salary by working for a larger dealership. After I made the switch, my salary increased by over $10,000 per year.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>The location where an ASE certified mechanic works can also impact their salary. In general, mechanics who work in larger cities or more affluent areas may earn higher salaries than those who work in rural areas or smaller towns.</p><h4>Specialty</h4><p>Finally, the specialty of an ASE certified mechanic can impact their earning potential. Mechanics who specialize in more complex systems, such as hybrid or electric vehicles, may earn more than those who work on traditional gasoline engines.</p><h2>Personal Experience: How My Specialty Impacted My Salary</h2><p>After working as a general mechanic for a few years, I decided to specialize in engine repair and maintenance. This decision paid off, as I was able to earn a higher salary by working on more complex systems.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: What is the median salary for ASE certified mechanics?</p><p>A: As of May 2020, the median annual salary for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050.</p><p>Q: What factors impact how much an ASE certified mechanic earns?</p><p>A: Factors that can impact how much an ASE certified mechanic earns include their level of experience, specialty, location, and type of employer.</p><p>Q: Do ASE certified mechanics earn more than non-certified mechanics?</p><p>A: In general, ASE certified mechanics earn higher salaries than non-certified mechanics.</p><p>Q: How can I increase my earning potential as an ASE certified mechanic?</p><p>A: To increase your earning potential as an ASE certified mechanic, consider specializing in a specific area of automotive repair or working for a larger, high-end automotive business.</p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Does an ASE Certified Mechanic Make?</h2><p>In conclusion, ASE certified mechanics can earn a competitive salary in the automotive industry.
