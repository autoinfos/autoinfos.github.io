It's an important question, and one that can have a big impact on your future. In this post, we'll take a deep dive into how much heavy equipment operators make per hour in Canada, and what factors can influence their earnings.</p><p>For many people, money is a major factor when choosing a career. You want to know that you'll be able to earn a good living doing the work you love. Heavy equipment operation can be a rewarding and challenging career, but it's important to know what you can expect to earn before you dive in.</p><p>According to the latest data from the Government of Canada, the average hourly wage for heavy equipment operators in Canada is $29.14 per hour.

Meanwhile, those in the Northwest Territories earn an average of just $22.25 per hour.</p><h3>Type of Equipment</h3><p>The type of equipment you operate can also impact your earnings. For example, crane operators tend to earn more than excavator operators, with an average hourly wage of $36.81 compared to $30.40. Similarly, those who operate large equipment like bulldozers and graders tend to earn more than those who operate smaller equipment like skid steers.</p><h4>Unionization</h4><p>Joining a union can also impact your earning potential as a heavy equipment operator. Unionized workers tend to earn higher wages than non-unionized workers, and they may also have access to additional benefits like health insurance and retirement plans.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Heavy Equipment Operation in Canada</h2><p>As a heavy equipment operator in Canada, I can tell you that the earning potential in this field is quite good. While your hourly wage will depend on a number of factors, there are plenty of opportunities to earn a good living doing this work.

You can find training programs at trade schools, community colleges, and other institutions across the country.</p><p>Once you've completed your training, you'll need to obtain any necessary certifications and licenses. This can vary depending on the province or territory where you work, so be sure to check the specific requirements in your area.</p><p>Finally, you'll need to start building your experience in the field. This may involve working as an apprentice or junior operator, or taking on entry-level positions in the industry. Over time, you can work your way up to more advanced positions and higher earning potential.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Is heavy equipment operation a good career choice in Canada?</h3><p>A: Absolutely.
