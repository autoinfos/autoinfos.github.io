If you're considering pursuing a career in phlebotomy, it's important to understand the earning potential in this field. In this blog post, we'll dive into the details of how much phlebotomists make in California, as well as some personal experiences and insights into the industry.</p><p>For many people, the salary they can earn is a major consideration when choosing a career. This is certainly the case for those interested in phlebotomy. After all, no one wants to invest time and money in training for a profession that doesn't pay the bills. Unfortunately, many healthcare jobs, including phlebotomy, are often underpaid and undervalued, despite their importance in patient care.</p><p>The average hourly wage for a phlebotomist in California is around $20-$25, depending on the location and employer. This may not seem like a significant amount, but it's important to keep in mind that many phlebotomists work part-time or on a per-diem basis, which can affect their earnings.
