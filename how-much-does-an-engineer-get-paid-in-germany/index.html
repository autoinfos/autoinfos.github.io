Look no further. In this article, we will explore the average salaries of engineers in Germany and what factors can affect your earning potential.</p><h2>Salary Pain Points for Engineers in Germany</h2><p>One of the biggest concerns for engineers moving to Germany is the cost of living versus the salary they can expect to earn.

However, this can vary depending on your field of engineering, level of experience, and location.
