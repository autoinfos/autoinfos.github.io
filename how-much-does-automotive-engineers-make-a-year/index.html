However, salaries can vary greatly depending on the factors mentioned above. Entry-level automotive engineers may make closer to $50,000 per year, while those with more experience and advanced degrees can earn upwards of $135,000 per year.</p><p>In summary, automotive engineers can expect to make a competitive salary, but it's important to keep in mind that many factors can impact their earnings.

However, I prepared by researching industry trends and putting together a list of my accomplishments and contributions to the company. When I presented my case to my employer, they were impressed and agreed to a higher salary. This experience taught me the importance of advocating for myself and doing my research to ensure fair pay.</p><h3>Factors that Impact an Automotive Engineer's Salary</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, there are many factors that can impact an automotive engineer's salary.
