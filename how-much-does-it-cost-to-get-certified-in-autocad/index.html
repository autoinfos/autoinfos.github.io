<meta name="description" content="How to get AutoCAD certificate from Autodesk. YouTubeAre you someone who is interested in learning AutoCAD? Do you want to become an expert in it? Well, you might be wondering how much does it cost to get certified in AutoCAD? As a beginner, it can be a daunting task to figure out the total cost of getting certified in AutoCAD. However, don&#39;t worry! In this blog post, we will explain everything you need to know about the costs associated with getting certified in AutoCAD.AutoCAD is a widely used software in the architecture and engineering industries. It is a highly technical software that requires a certain level of expertise to operate. Therefore, it is crucial to get certified in AutoCAD to gain credibility and increase your chances of getting hired by top-notch firms.The cost of getting certified in AutoCAD varies depending on the level of certification you want to achieve. There are three levels of certification: Autodesk Certified User (ACU), Autodesk Certified Professional (ACP), and Autodesk Certified Instructor (ACI). The cost of each certification varies, with ACU being the cheapest and ACI being the most expensive. The cost of ACU is around $95, while ACP costs around $245, and ACI costs around $495.In conclusion, the cost of getting certified in AutoCAD ranges from $95 to $495, depending on the level of certification you want to achieve. However, it is important to note that the certification fee is just one part of the total cost. You also need to factor in the cost of training materials, training courses, and other associated costs.Autodesk Certified User (ACU)When I was learning AutoCAD, I decided to start with the Autodesk Certified User (ACU) certification. It was the perfect starting point for me as it covered all the basic concepts of AutoCAD. The certification cost me $95, and I was able to take the exam online. The exam had 35 questions, and I had 1 hour to complete it. I passed the exam on my first attempt, and it gave me the confidence to pursue higher levels of certification.Autodesk Certified Professional (ACP)After I completed the ACU certification, I decided to pursue the Autodesk Certified Professional (ACP) certification. The certification covers advanced concepts of AutoCAD and is ideal for professionals who want to enhance their skills. The cost of the ACP certification is $245, and the exam has 35 questions. The time limit for the exam is 2 hours, and you need to score a minimum of 70% to pass the exam.Additional CostsAside from the certification cost, you also need to factor in the cost of training materials and training courses. There are various online courses and training materials available to help you prepare for the certification exam. The cost of these materials varies depending on the provider. You can also attend training courses, which can cost anywhere from $500 to $2000.How to Reduce Costs?If you want to reduce the cost of getting certified in AutoCAD, you can opt for self-study. There are various free resources available online, such as YouTube tutorials and blogs, that can help you prepare for the certification exam. However, it is important to note that self-study requires a lot of dedication and discipline, and it might take longer to achieve your certification.Conclusion of How Much Does It Cost to Get Certified in AutoCADIn conclusion, the cost of getting certified in AutoCAD varies depending on the level of certification you want to achieve.
