<meta name="description" content="How Much Do Auto Mechanics Make in May 2020? Road Car AccessoriesAre you considering a career in mechanics but wondering how much money you can make? Do you currently work as a mechanic and want to know if you&#39;re being paid fairly? Whatever your situation may be, understanding the average salary of a mechanic can give you a clearer picture of the earning potential in this field.As with any profession, there are both advantages and disadvantages to becoming a mechanic. One of the most commonly asked questions is how much money does mechanics make a year? While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, there are several factors that can impact a mechanic&#39;s salary.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020. This means that half of all mechanics earned more than this amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent of mechanics earned less than $25,000 per year, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $66,950 per year.In order to earn a higher salary as a mechanic, it&#39;s important to consider factors such as education, experience, location, and industry. Mechanics who have completed formal training programs, such as those offered at technical schools or community colleges, may be more desirable to employers and therefore earn higher salaries. Similarly, mechanics who have been in the field for a longer period of time may have developed more specialized skills and knowledge, leading to higher pay.Personal ExperienceWhen I first started working as a mechanic, I was making around $30,000 per year. However, as I gained more experience and completed additional training programs, my salary increased to around $50,000 per year. I also found that working for a dealership or specialized repair shop, such as those that focus on luxury vehicles, tended to pay more than working for a general repair shop.Location and IndustryAnother factor that can impact a mechanic&#39;s salary is their location and the industry they work in. Mechanics who work in larger cities or in more affluent areas may earn higher salaries due to the higher cost of living. Similarly, mechanics who work in specialized industries, such as aviation or marine mechanics, may earn higher salaries due to the specialized nature of their work.Additional Education or CertificationsOne way to increase your earning potential as a mechanic is to pursue additional education or certifications. For example, becoming certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) can demonstrate to employers that you have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform high-quality work. Additionally, pursuing further education in areas such as diesel engine repair or hybrid technology can also make you a more valuable employee and lead to higher pay.Negotiating Your SalaryIf you&#39;re currently working as a mechanic and feel that you&#39;re not being paid fairly, it may be worth having a conversation with your employer about your salary. In many cases, employers are willing to negotiate salaries in order to keep valuable employees. Be sure to come to the negotiation armed with information about the average salaries for mechanics in your area and with your level of experience.Personal ExperienceWhen I was working for a dealership, I felt that I wasn&#39;t being paid fairly for the amount of work I was doing. However, when I approached my supervisor with information about the average salaries for mechanics in our area, they were willing to increase my pay to a more reasonable level.Question and AnswerQ: What industries tend to pay mechanics the most?A: Mechanics who work in specialized industries, such as aviation or marine mechanics, may earn higher salaries due to the specialized nature of their work.Q: Can pursuing additional education or certifications lead to higher pay as a mechanic?A: Yes, becoming certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) or pursuing further education in areas such as diesel engine repair or hybrid technology can make you a more valuable employee and lead to higher pay.Q: Is it possible to negotiate your salary as a mechanic?A: Yes, in many cases employers are willing to negotiate salaries in order to keep valuable employees.
