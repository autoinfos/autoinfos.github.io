According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage of automotive service technicians and mechanics was $20.24 as of May 2020.

The earning potential of a mechanic depends on several factors, such as their experience, location, and the type of employer they work for. Aspiring mechanics should consider these factors when deciding whether to pursue this profession or not.</p><h2>How Much Per Hour Does a Mechanic Make and Its Target</h2><p>When I was in high school, I had a passion for cars and wanted to become a mechanic. However, I was curious about how much per hour does a mechanic make.

Entry-level mechanics usually earn less than experienced mechanics. Location is also a crucial factor in determining the salary of a mechanic.

Mechanics who specialize in repairing high-end luxury cars usually earn more than those who work on regular cars.</p><h3>Education and Training</h3><p>Education and training are also essential factors that affect the hourly wage of a mechanic. Mechanics who have completed formal training programs or have certifications usually earn more than those who do not. Employers prefer to hire mechanics who have completed training programs because they are more knowledgeable and skilled in repairing vehicles.</p><h4>Negotiation Skills</h4><p>Lastly, negotiation skills also play a significant role in determining the hourly wage of a mechanic. Mechanics who have excellent negotiation skills can negotiate higher salaries or hourly rates than those who do not. Negotiation skills also help mechanics secure better benefits and working conditions.</p><h2>Personal Experience About How Much Per Hour Does a Mechanic Make</h2><p>When I started working as a mechanic, I was earning $15 per hour. However, after gaining some experience and completing training programs, my hourly wage increased to $25 per hour. I also worked for a dealership, which paid more than independent garages. Negotiation skills also helped me secure better benefits, such as health insurance and paid vacation days.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: How much does an entry-level mechanic earn per hour?</h3><p>A: Entry-level mechanics usually earn between $12 to $15 per hour.</p><h3>Q: What factors affect the hourly wage of a mechanic?</h3><p>A: The hourly wage of a mechanic depends on factors such as experience, location, employer, type of vehicles they work on, education and training, and negotiation skills.</p><h3>Q: Can mechanics earn more than $34 per hour?</h3><p>A: Yes, mechanics who specialize in repairing high-end luxury cars or work for reputable dealerships can earn more than $34 per hour.</p><h3>Q: How can mechanics negotiate higher salaries?</h3><p>A: Mechanics can negotiate higher salaries by demonstrating their skills and knowledge, showing their willingness to learn and grow, and highlighting their achievements and contributions to the company.</p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Per Hour Does a Mechanic Make</h2><p>The hourly wage of a mechanic varies depending on several factors such as experience, location, employer, type of vehicles they work on, education and training, and negotiation skills.
