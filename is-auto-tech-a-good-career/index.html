Many employers offer opportunities for advancement, such as becoming a senior technician or shop supervisor. Additionally, obtaining certification from organizations such as the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) can further enhance your skills and marketability.</p><h2>Job Outlook and Salary</h2><p>The job outlook for auto tech professionals is positive, with job growth projected to be faster than average. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $42,090 as of May 2020. However, salaries can vary based on experience, location, and employer.</p><p>My personal experience with salary in this field has been positive.
