Additionally, taking regular breaks and stretching can help prevent muscle strain and other injuries. By prioritizing your health and safety, you can enjoy a long and fulfilling career as a car mechanic.</p><h2>Personal Experience:</h2><p>As a car mechanic for over 10 years, I have seen my fair share of accidents and injuries in the workplace.
