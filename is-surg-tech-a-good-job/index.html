Are you wondering if it's a good job with a decent salary and job security? Look no further, because we've got you covered! In this post, we'll dive into the world of surgical technology and answer the question, "Is surg tech a good job?"</p><p>Many people may be hesitant to pursue a career in surgical technology due to the level of responsibility and pressure that comes with the job. However, the demand for surgical technologists is on the rise, and the salary and job security are both very appealing.</p><p>The answer to whether or not surg tech is a good job is a resounding yes! According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for surgical technologists was $49,710 in May 2020, with the top 10 percent earning more than $71,400. Additionally, the employment of surgical technologists is projected to grow 7 percent from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations.</p><p>In summary, surg tech is a great career choice with a solid salary and job security. But don't just take our word for it, let's dive deeper into the reasons why.</p><p><h2>The Benefits of Being a Surgical Technologist</h2></p><p>As a surgical technologist, you play a critical role on the surgical team, assisting surgeons and nurses during procedures. Not only do you get to be a part of saving lives, but you also have the opportunity to work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, outpatient centers, and clinics.</p><p>Personally, I have been a surgical technologist for over 10 years, and I can attest to the rewarding nature of the job. The feeling of being a part of a team that saves lives is indescribable. Additionally, the job requires you to be detail-oriented, quick on your feet, and able to handle high-stress situations, which keeps the job exciting and challenging.</p><p><h2>The Education and Training Required</h2></p><p>To become a surgical technologist, you typically need an associate's degree or a postsecondary certificate from an accredited surgical technology program. These programs typically take 9-24 months to complete and include clinical training in addition to classroom study.</p><p>After completing your education, you will need to become certified. The National Board of Surgical Technology and Surgical Assisting offers the Certified Surgical Technologist (CST) credential, which requires passing an exam. Many employers require certification, so it's important to obtain it as soon as possible.</p><p><h3>The Day-to-Day Responsibilities of a Surgical Technologist</h3></p><p>As a surgical technologist, your day-to-day responsibilities will vary depending on the type of surgery and the setting in which you work. However, some common tasks include preparing the operating room, sterilizing instruments, handing instruments to surgeons and nurses during procedures, and monitoring the patient's vital signs.</p><p>One of the best things about the job is that no two days are the same. Each surgery is unique, and you never know what you might encounter, which keeps the job interesting and engaging.</p><p><h4>How to Advance Your Career as a Surgical Technologist</h4></p><p>If you're looking to advance your career as a surgical technologist, there are several options available. One option is to specialize in a particular type of surgery, such as neurosurgery or orthopedics. Another option is to become a surgical first assistant, which involves more advanced duties, such as suturing and tissue manipulation.</p><p>Additionally, you could pursue a career in healthcare management or education, or even become a traveling surgical technologist, which involves traveling to different hospitals and surgical centers to assist with procedures.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p>Q: Is surg tech a good job for people who are squeamish or afraid of blood?</p><p>A: While the job does involve working with blood and other bodily fluids, many surgical technologists report becoming desensitized to it over time. Additionally, there are many areas of surgery that do not involve much blood, such as ophthalmology or podiatry.</p><p>Q: How long does it take to become a surgical technologist?</p><p>A: Most surgical technology programs take 9-24 months to complete, depending on the program and level of education you are seeking.</p><p>Q: What are the working hours like for a surgical technologist?</p><p>A: Working hours vary depending on the setting in which you work. Many surgical technologists work in hospitals, which means they may work early morning, evening, or overnight shifts. However, some outpatient centers and clinics offer more regular business hours.</p><p>Q: Can surgical technologists specialize in a particular type of surgery?</p><p>A: Yes, surgical technologists can specialize in a particular type of surgery, such as neurosurgery or orthopedics. Specializing can lead to higher pay and more job opportunities.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Is Surg Tech a Good Job?</h2></p><p>Overall, surgical technology is a great career choice with a solid salary and job security. As a surgical technologist, you have the opportunity to work in a variety of settings, save lives, and advance your career over time. So if you're considering becoming a surgical technologist, go for it! It's a rewarding and fulfilling career that you won't regret.</p></article>
