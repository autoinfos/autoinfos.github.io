Additionally, some states require technicians to hold a license in order to work in certain fields, such as HVAC or plumbing.</p><p><b>Q: How do I negotiate my salary as a service repair technician?</b></p><p>A: When negotiating your salary, it's important to do your research and have a clear understanding of what other technicians in your area and with your level of experience are earning.
