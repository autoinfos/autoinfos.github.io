Companies like Endurance, CARCHEX, and CarShield have established themselves as industry leaders and are worth considering when buying an extended auto warranty.</p><p><h2>Endurance: A Top Extended Auto Warranty Company</h2></p><p>When I bought my used car, I knew I needed an extended auto warranty to protect myself from unexpected repair costs.
