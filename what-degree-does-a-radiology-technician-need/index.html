<meta name="description" content="What Does a Radiologic Technologist Do? The Complete GuideAre you interested in becoming a radiology technician but unsure of the degree you need? As with any medical profession, obtaining the proper education and training is essential to a successful career. Without the right degree, you may find it difficult to secure a job or advance in the field.One of the biggest pain points for those interested in becoming a radiology technician is determining what degree is necessary. While there are various educational paths you can take, the most common degree for radiology technicians is an associate’s degree.An associate’s degree in radiologic technology typically takes two years to complete and is offered at community colleges, technical schools, and some universities. This degree program will provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to perform x-rays, MRIs, and other diagnostic imaging tests.In summary, a radiology technician typically needs an associate’s degree in radiologic technology to enter the profession. This degree program will prepare you for a successful career in the field by providing you with the necessary knowledge and skills.Why an Associate’s Degree is NecessaryWhen I was considering becoming a radiology technician, I was unsure of the degree I needed. After researching the field, I found that an associate’s degree in radiologic technology was necessary for most entry-level positions. This degree program provided me with hands-on training and in-depth knowledge of radiologic technology, allowing me to excel in my career.Advancing Your Career with a Bachelor’s DegreeWhile an associate’s degree is sufficient for most entry-level positions, some radiology technicians choose to advance their careers by obtaining a bachelor’s degree. A bachelor’s degree in radiologic technology can lead to higher-paying positions, such as a radiology department supervisor or a healthcare administrator.Choosing the Right ProgramWhen choosing a radiologic technology program, it’s important to consider accreditation. Look for programs that are accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) or the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). These accreditations ensure that the program meets high standards and will provide you with the education and training needed to succeed in the field.Continuing Education RequirementsAfter obtaining your degree and entering the field, it’s important to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and technologies in radiologic technology. Many states require continuing education credits for radiology technicians to maintain their licensure. Continuing education can be obtained through workshops, seminars, and online courses.Personal ExperienceWhen I first started my career as a radiology technician, I had an associate’s degree in radiologic technology. While this degree was sufficient for my entry-level position, I decided to advance my career by obtaining a bachelor’s degree. This decision allowed me to take on higher-paying positions and eventually become a healthcare administrator.Question and AnswerQ: Can I become a radiology technician without a degree?A: While it’s not impossible, most employers require a minimum of an associate’s degree in radiologic technology.Q: Can I obtain a degree in radiologic technology online?A: Yes, there are online programs available for radiologic technology degrees. However, it’s important to ensure the program is accredited and provides hands-on training opportunities.Q: How long does it take to obtain a degree in radiologic technology?A: An associate’s degree in radiologic technology typically takes two years to complete, while a bachelor’s degree can take four years.Q: What kind of courses will I take in a radiologic technology program?A: Courses in a radiologic technology program may include anatomy and physiology, patient care, imaging techniques and procedures, radiation biology and protection, and medical terminology.ConclusionIn conclusion, obtaining the proper degree is essential for a successful career as a radiology technician. While an associate’s degree in radiologic technology is the most common degree, some choose to advance their careers with a bachelor’s degree. When choosing a program, be sure to consider accreditation and continuing education requirements to ensure you receive the best education and training possible..">
