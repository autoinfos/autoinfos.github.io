One time, I was driving on the freeway when my car suddenly started making a strange noise. I pulled over and called my trusted auto tech. He quickly diagnosed the problem and fixed it on the spot, allowing me to get back on the road in no time.</p><p>What I appreciated most about my auto tech was his ability to explain the problem to me in simple terms.

First, look for someone who has experience working on your specific make and model of car. They'll have a better understanding of any quirks or issues that may arise.</p><p>You should also look for someone who is honest and transparent.
