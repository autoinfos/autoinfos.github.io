The pharmacy technician took the time to sit down with the patient and explain each medication, how to take it, and what side effects to expect. The patient left feeling much more confident about managing their medication regimen. It was a great example of how pharmacy technicians can make a real difference in patients' lives.</p><h2>How to Become a Pharmacy Technician</h2><p>If you're interested in becoming a pharmacy technician, there are a few steps you'll need to take.
