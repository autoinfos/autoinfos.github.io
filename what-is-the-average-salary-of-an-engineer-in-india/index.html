However, there are several resources available that can help you get a better idea of what to expect.</p><p>Websites such as Payscale and Glassdoor provide salary data for various engineering roles in India. It can also be helpful to network with other engineers in your field to get an idea of what the going rate is for your experience level and industry.</p><h4>How to Negotiate a Fair Salary as an Engineer in India</h4><p>If you are currently in the process of negotiating a salary for an engineering job in India, there are several things you can do to increase your chances of getting a fair offer. First, do your research and find out what the going rate is for your role in your industry and location.</p><p>Next, be prepared to make a case for why you are worth the salary you are asking for.
