This includes checking the engine, brakes, transmission, suspension, tires, and electrical system. Your mechanic will also look for signs of previous accidents, flood damage, or other issues that might not be visible to the naked eye.</p><p><h4>How Do You Negotiate a Better Price After a Pre-Purchase Inspection?</h4></p><p>If your mechanic finds any issues with the car, you can use this information to negotiate a better price.
